In this task, the paragraphs will be displayed with a technique called rapid

serial visual presentation (RSVP). This means that the paragraphs will be shown

one word at a time, at the centre of the screen. In order to read them, all you

need to do is look at the centre of the screen untill all words in the paragraph
 
have been presented. We will start with a short demonstration of the technique.
