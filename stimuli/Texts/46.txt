As Earth warms due to the human-caused release of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, frozen
Arctic soils also warm, thaw and release more carbon dioxide. The added carbon dioxide accelerates
Earth's warming, which further accelerates the thawing of Arctic soils and the release of even more
carbon dioxide.
