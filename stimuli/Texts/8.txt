The human body can tolerate only a small range of temperature, especially when the person is
engaged in vigorous activity. Heat reactions usually occur when large amounts of water and/or salt
are lost through excessive sweating following strenuous exercise. When the body becomes overheated
and cannot eliminate this excess heat, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are possible.
