Known as Rapa Nui to the island's inhabitants, Rongorongo is a writing system comprised of
pictographs. It has been found carved into many oblong wooden tablets and other artifacts from the
island's history. The art of writing was not known in any nearby islands and the script's mere
existence is sufficient to confound anthropologists.
