Steam sterilization is limited in the types of medical waste it can treat, but is appropriate for
laboratory cultures and substances contaminated with infectious organisms. The waste is subjected
to steam in a sealed, pressurized chamber. The liquid that may form is drained off to the sewer or
sent for processing.
