Greg Anderson, considered a key witness by the prosecution, vowed he wouldn't testify when served a
subpoena last week. His lawyers said he was prepared for a third prison stay to maintain his
silence. Anderson was released July 20 after a two-week stay for previously declining to testify
before a different grand jury.
