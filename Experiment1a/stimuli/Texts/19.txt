Interestingly, the heaviest isotopes physicists have managed to synthesize so far don't behave
quite like science's best current models predict, so stable superheavy nuclei are likely to be full
of surprises. Chemists cannot even predict with any certainty whether these materials will exist as
gases, liquids, or solids at room temperature.
